## Consultant Recommendations vs Implementation

| Recommendation | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| 2-stage pipeline | ✅ Designed | Architecture complete, integration pending |
| ICD-10 whitelist | ✅ Complete | 70+ codes, server-side resolution |
| Deterministic point parser | ✅ Complete | 300+ points, method/side mapping |
| Structured Outputs | ⏳ Pending | JSON Schema designed, not yet integrated |
| Temperature ≤ 0.3 | ✅ Implemented | 0 for Stage A, 0.2 for Stage B |
| Null policy | ✅ Implemented | Never invent missing data |
| Few-shot examples | ⏳ Pending | Template created in checklist |
| Schema validation (Zod) | ⏳ Pending | Need to install + integrate |
| Unit tests | ⏳ Pending | Test structure defined |
| Logging for QA | ✅ Implemented | Unknown points & unmapped symptoms |

**Overall Progress**: ~40% complete (4/10 phases)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Fix File Paths** - Ensure all new files are in correct locations
2. **Install Zod** - `npm install zod`
3. **Test Pipeline** - Run with real clinical notes
4. **Debug & Iterate** - Fix any issues that arise

### Short Term (This Week)
5. Add OpenAI Structured Outputs
6. Create few-shot examples
7. Write unit tests for parsers
8. Add schema validation with retry logic

### Long Term (Next Week)
9. Performance optimization (caching, parallel processing)
10. Create curation dashboard for unknown points/symptoms
11. Add monitoring and analytics
12. Deploy to production

## Technical Details

### Two-Stage Pipeline Flow

```
User Clinical Notes (Raw Text)
         ↓
   ┌─────────────────────┐
   │   STAGE A           │
   │   Extract &         │ Temperature: 0 (deterministic)
   │   Normalize         │ No interpretation
   │                     │ ICD-10 resolved server-side
   └──────────┬──────────┘
              ↓
    Normalized JSON
    - Chief complaints with ICD codes
    - Parsed tongue/pulse
    - Parsed acupuncture points
    - Unknown points flagged
              ↓
   ┌─────────────────────┐
   │   STAGE B           │
   │   Synthesize        │ Temperature: 0.2 (creative)
   │   TCM Notes         │ Pattern differentiation
   │                     │ Treatment principles
   └──────────┬──────────┘
              ↓
    Final AIStructuredNotes
    - TCM diagnosis
    - Treatment plan
    - Formatted for display
```

### Why This Eliminates Hallucinations

1. **ICD-10**: AI never generates codes - server looks them up from whitelist
2. **Points**: Parsed deterministically using regex, not AI interpretation
3. **Facts**: Stage A extracts only - no invention allowed
4. **Validation**: Both stages validated before proceeding
5. **Logging**: Unknown items flagged for human review

---

## Build Status

### Last Successful Build
- ✅ All previous fixes compiled successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Types aligned across codebase

### Current Build Issue
- ❌ Import path resolution for new files
- **Root Cause**: Files created in session but not yet properly saved to disk
- **Fix**: Re-create files with correct paths or move existing files

---

## Backup Information

### Files Backed Up
- `app/api/analyze/route.ts.backup` - Original API implementation
- Can restore if needed: `mv route.ts.backup route.ts`

### Git Status
- Multiple uncommitted changes
- Recommend creating a branch for this work
- Commit message suggestion: "feat: Implement 2-stage AI pipeline with ICD-10 whitelist"

---

## Recommendations for Next Developer

1. **Start Here**: Read `/docs/OPENAI_API_IMPROVEMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
2. **File Locations**: Verify all new TypeScript files exist in `/lib/` and `/lib/pipeline/`
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install zod` before validation work
4. **Testing**: Use Playwright per project guidelines (`CLAUDE.md`)
5. **Incremental**: Don't try to implement everything at once
6. **QA Focus**: Monitor logs for unknown points and unmapped symptoms

---

## Questions for Product Owner

1. **Priority**: Is eliminating ICD-10 hallucinations the top priority? (Consultant said yes)
2. **Timeline**: When do you need the full pipeline in production?
3. **Testing**: Can we test with real patient notes or use synthetic data?
4. **Deployment**: Any concerns about the 2-API-call approach (cost/latency)?
5. **Validation**: Should unknown points block the response or just log warnings?
