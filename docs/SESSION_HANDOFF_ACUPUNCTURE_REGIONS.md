# Session Handoff: Acupuncture Region Mapping Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implementation Complete, Ready for Testing
**Dev Server:** Running on `http://localhost:3002` (background process c56a78)

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Simplified AI Pipeline for Acupuncture Points**

**Problem:** AI was guessing regions and inferring methods from context, causing inaccuracies.

**Solution:** Two-stage approach:
- **AI extracts:** Flat list of points with `name`, `side`, `method`
- **Code organizes:** Uses comprehensive channel mapping to assign correct regions

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/ai/pipeline.ts` - Updated prompt, added post-processing
- `lib/schemas/aiNotesSchema.ts` - Changed from nested regions to flat `acupuncturePoints`
- `types/ai-notes.ts` - Types already matched (no changes needed)

---

## üîë Key Implementation Details

### Schema Changes

**Before (AI organized by region):**
```json
{
  "acupuncture": [
    {
      "region": "Back",
      "points": [{"name": "BL-20", "side": "Both", "method": "T"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

**After (AI extracts flat, code organizes):**
```json
{
  "acupuncturePoints": [
    {"name": "BL-20", "side": null, "method": "T"},
    {"name": "BL-23", "side": null, "method": null}
  ],
  "acupuncture": [
    {
      "region": "Back",
      "points": [
        {"name": "BL-20", "side": null, "method": "T"},
        {"name": "BL-23", "side": null, "method": null}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Both `acupuncturePoints` (flat) and `acupuncture` (organized) are in the final output.

## üìã Ultra-Strict Acupuncture Extraction Rules

### Method Extraction (CRITICAL)

**Rule:** Method descriptors apply ONLY to the immediate point following them.

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ `"tonifying on BL-20, BL-23"` ‚Üí BL-20: method "T", BL-23: method null
- ‚úÖ `"BL-20 (T), BL-23 (R)"` ‚Üí BL-20: method "T", BL-23: method "R"
- ‚úÖ `"reducing on LV-3, tonifying on KI-3"` ‚Üí LV-3: method "R", KI-3: method "T"
- ‚ùå `"BL-20, BL-23"` (no methods) ‚Üí Both get null

**Default:** `null` (not specified)
**No inference, no context guessing!**

### Side Extraction (CRITICAL)

**Rule:** `side: null` means inherit from `acupunctureTreatmentSide`.

**Examples:**
- Overall side: "Both", Point: "BL-20" ‚Üí `side: null` (inherits "Both")
- Overall side: "Both", Point: "BL-20 left only" ‚Üí `side: "Left"` (explicit override)

**Default:** `null` (inherits from overall side)

### Treatment Side

**Field:** `acupunctureTreatmentSide`
**Values:** "Left", "Right", "Both"
**Default:** "Both" if not specified

## üó∫Ô∏è Region Mapping System

### New File: `lib/utils/acupunctureRegions.ts`

**Contains:**
- 14 channel mappings (LU, LI, ST, SP, HT, SI, BL, KD, PC, SJ, GB, LV, REN, DU)
- Point number ranges ‚Üí Anatomical regions
- Extra points mapping (Yin Tang, Tai Yang, etc.)
- Parser for various formats: "BL-20", "BL20", "GV-20", "CV-6"

**Key Functions:**
- `parsePointCode()` - Converts "BL-20" to {channel: "BL", number: "20"}
- `determineRegion()` - Looks up correct region using mapping
- `organizePointsByRegion()` - Groups flat points by region

**Example Mapping:**
```typescript
BL: [
  ["1", "2", "Face"],
  ["3", "9", "Head"],
  ["11", "25", "Back"],
  ["26", "35", "Hip"],
  // ...
]
```

**Post-Processing Flow:**
1. AI returns flat `acupuncturePoints` array
2. `organizePointsByRegion()` parses each point code
3. Looks up region using channel + number mapping
4. Groups points by region
5. Returns organized `acupuncture` array

## üß™ Testing

### Test Page: `/prompt`

**Location:** `http://localhost:3002/prompt`

**Features:**
- Left panel: Textarea for unstructured notes
- Right panel: Raw JSON output
- "Load Example" button for sample data
- Copy/Download buttons

**Test Results (Last Run):**
- ‚úÖ Response time: 12.8 seconds
- ‚úÖ Points correctly extracted
- ‚úÖ Regions properly organized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some points go to "Other" region (GV-20, CV-6, KI-3) - parser handles CV/GV but may need refinement

**Points Tested:**
```
Input: GV-20, Yin Tang, BL-18, BL-20, BL-23, CV-6, ST-25, LV-3, KI-3, ST-36

Output Regions:
- Abdomen: ST-25
- Back: BL-18, BL-20, BL-23
- Foot: LV-3
- Head: Yin Tang
- Lower Leg: ST-36, KI-3
- Other: GV-20, CV-6
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / To-Do

### 1. **"Other" Region Points**

Some valid points are going to "Other" region:
- **GV-20** (should be "Head" - DU 17-24)
- **CV-6** (should be "Abdomen" - REN 3-16)
- **KI-3** (should be "Foot" - KD 1-6)

**Status:** Parser updated to handle CV/GV‚ÜíREN/DU conversion, but may need testing.

### 2. **Master Tung Points Not Mapped**

Points like "Wu Xiong", "San Yang", "Ling Gu" will go to "Other" region.

**Solution Options:**
- Add to `EXTRA_POINTS` mapping in `acupunctureRegions.ts`
- Keep "Other" as catch-all for non-standard points
- User can decide based on usage patterns

**Example Addition:**
```typescript
const EXTRA_POINTS: Record<string, string> = {
  // Existing
  "Yin Tang": "Head",

  // Master Tung Points - Hand
  "Wu Xiong": "Hand",
  "San Yang": "Hand",
  "Ling Gu": "Hand",
  "Da Bai": "Hand",
  // Add more as needed
};
```

### 3. **Schema Still Has `strict: false`**

**Reason:** OpenAI Structured Outputs with `strict: true` doesn't support optional properties.

**Impact:** Minimal - still validates against schema, just more flexible.

**File:** `lib/schemas/aiNotesSchema.ts` line 15

## üöÄ Next Steps for New Agent

### Immediate Testing (High Priority)

1. **Test Strict Method Rules**
   ```
   Test input: "tonifying on BL-20, BL-23"
   Expected: BL-20 method "T", BL-23 method null
   Verify: AI follows the rule correctly
   ```

2. **Test Side Inheritance**
   ```
   Test input: Treatment side "Both", points without explicit sides
   Expected: All points have side: null
   Verify: null properly inherits "Both"
   ```

3. **Test with Real User Notes**
   - Use `/prompt` page at `http://localhost:3002/prompt`
   - Input actual clinical notes
   - Verify all points are extracted correctly
   - Check region organization accuracy

### Enhancements (Medium Priority)

1. **Expand Master Tung Mapping**
   - Add common Master Tung points to `EXTRA_POINTS`
   - User will provide list if needed

2. **Fix "Other" Region Issues**
   - Test CV/GV parser fix
   - Verify GV-20, CV-6, KI-3 go to correct regions

3. **Add Validation Warnings**
   - Log when points go to "Other" region
   - Help user identify unmapped points

### Polish (Low Priority)

1. **UI Enhancement**
   - Display organized regions in test page
   - Show both flat and organized output

2. **Documentation**
   - Add inline comments to region mapping
   - Create user guide for adding new points

## üí° Important Context for New Agent

### User's Requirements

1. **Precision Over Inference**
   - Never guess methods from context
   - Only extract explicitly stated information
   - `null` means "use default", not "unknown"

2. **Regional Organization**
   - Use provided channel mapping (100% accurate)
   - Don't trust AI to organize regions
   - Post-process for accuracy

3. **TCM Clinical Context**
   - This is for real clinical documentation
   - Accuracy is critical for patient care
   - Side and method affect treatment outcome

### Technical Constraints

1. **Token Efficiency**
   - Post-processing uses zero AI tokens
   - Single AI request (no two-stage API calls)
   - Simpler prompt = better performance

2. **Schema Limitations**
   - OpenAI `strict: true` doesn't support dynamic keys
   - Using `strict: false` for flexibility
   - Still validates against schema

---

## üêõ Debugging Tips

### If Points Go to Wrong Regions

1. Check console logs: `[Acupuncture] Could not parse point: "XXX"`
2. Test parser: Does `parsePointCode()` return correct channel/number?
3. Check mapping: Is channel defined in `CHANNEL_REGION_MAP`?
4. Verify range: Is point number within a defined range?

### If AI Guesses Methods

1. Review prompt: Are critical rules clear?
2. Check examples in prompt: Do they demonstrate correct behavior?
3. Test temperature: May need to lower from 0.3 to 0.2
4. Verify schema: Is method field properly typed with null option?

### If Side Inheritance Breaks

1. Verify `acupunctureTreatmentSide` has valid value
2. Check points with `side: null` in output
3. Confirm UI/frontend properly interprets null as inheriting overall side
